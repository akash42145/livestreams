Good day!

Nice article on the ReentrantRradWriteLock and StampedLock.

I have a quick question and it would be great if you could throw some lights.

Given:
In both ReentrantReadWriteLock and StampedLock, the concurrency design is to support multiple (several in large numbers) readers or one writer (mutual exclusivity between readers and writer) ie., the expectation is that multiple readers almost always keep reading. Chances for zero reader locks or preemptive scheduling for the writer thread may not occur for a long time.

Question:
When there is a writer thread, wonâ€™t it get to a stage where it never gets a chance to write or writer thread chances to acquire the lock is heavily delayed? Could this occur frequently in these two type of locks? If so, do you suggest a pattern to avoid this issue?

Appreciate your inputs on this.
